# US-SuperResolution

We provide our trained models for super-resolution prediction on different anatomical districts and up-sampling factors.

Furthermore, we provide pseudo-code for both the prediction and the training of the networks.

# Requirements
Tested with Matlab2021b, Tensorflow 2.7.0, Tensorlayer 2.2.4.

Matlab toolbox:  
-Image processing  
-Deep Learning

# Results
We report a summary of the results; for further details, please refer to the paper.
